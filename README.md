# Webcam App
I created this app to improve my javascript skills. It captures the user's webcam and projects the video onto a canvas. It also applies a filter. You can play around with different filters by changing the 'rgb' values in the function 'filter'.
You can also click a picture and download it. This app also works on mobile.

Try it and have fun!
